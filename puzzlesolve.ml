(*======================================================================
Before working on this problem set, read the problem set 6 writeup in
the file `readme.pdf`. It provides context and crucial information for
completing the problems. In addition, make sure that you are familiar
with the problem set procedures in the document "Problem set
procedures for CS51".

You are allowed (and encouraged) to work with a partner on this
problem set. You are also allowed to work alone, if you prefer. See

(* This file contains the `PUZZLESOLVER` signature for modules that
solve particular puzzles, as well as a higher-order functor,
`MakePuzzleSolver`. A `PUZZLESOLVER` module solves the puzzle by
searching for a path from the initial state to the goal state.

The `MakePuzzleSolver` functor takes a `COLLECTION` functor and a
`PUZZLEDESCRIPTION` and returns a `PUZZLESOLVER`. The collection
specified by the functor is used to store the states that have been
reached so far. Thus, the ordering in which states are delivered by
the collection (using the `take` function) determines the order in
which the states are searched. A stack regime gives depth-first
search, a queue regime breadth-first search.

At the bottom of the file are definitions for depth-first search and
breadth-first search puzzle solvers. These are partially applied
versions of the `MakePuzzleSolver` functor that use certain
collections to engender different search methods.

This file makes use of the `Set` and `Collections` module, as well as the
`PuzzleDescription` module (which it opens).

   A functor that given a functor from an element type to a
   `COLLECTION`, as well as a `PUZZLEDESCRIPTION`, returns a full
   `PUZZLESOLVER` module.

   The functor `MakeCollection` is used for generating the collection
   for storing pending states that have yet to be searched. Using
   different collection regimes -- stacks (`MakeStackList`), queues
   (`MakeQueueList`, `MakeQueueStack`), etc. -- leads to different
   search regimes -- depth-first, breadth-first, etc.
